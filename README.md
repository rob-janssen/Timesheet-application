# Timesheet application

Well, as a self-employed IT guy :) I was creating my weekly, or monthly timesheets in Excel, exported them to PDF and sent them to my customers for signing and invoicing references.
In my 'journey' as a full-stack developer this is the perfect exercise for learning and to make it a lot easier for myself regarding my timesheets.

The frontend is a React/Typescript app.
The backend is a Typescript backend API based on GraphQL with a MongoDB database.
